### Bug Reporting

Here are a few helpful tips when reporting a bug:

- To report a bug, please use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).
- Make sure what you are describing is a bug and not a feature request. Is this how it was originally designed to work?
- Screenshots are very helpful in diagnosing bugs; please include them whenever possible.
- Check the console for errors and [copy or snapshot the output](https://zapier.com/help/troubleshoot/behavior/view-and-save-your-browser-console-logs).  Please document this in your issue.
